# My Awesome Project
Starwars films and Character App
# How It's Made :nut_and_bolt:ðŸ”¨ :hammer::wrench::


## Optimizations.
Right now, I can pull the data from the two endpoints for the Film names and Characters on Star Wars Api. I have pulled down the film data and rendered the information on cards on the main page and setup react-router for the characters pages that will take data of the characters urls from the films data objects. 

As of right now I am running into a problem with checking the entries of both objects to render the characters from each individual film once selected. I thought I would be able to get the film data from the api and render the names of the characters of the films but It renders the endpoint of the characters in the films scheme instead of the name. 

So I am now trying to write out the function to handle the onClick of the films to render out the individual characters list by passing it the two data objects ({films.url} === {characters.url}) and check for the urls values and if they are related
